A javascript product card
The card displays an image, a title, description for each of the 4 products total
There is a next and previous button below all product info
This allows user to cycle through each product and its information

As a result of this project : 
It helped me understand the use of objects,
Manipule the DOM to display different objects on the card,
Accessing properties of an object, and how to navigate through an array of objects
